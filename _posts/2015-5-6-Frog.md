title:Frog: Asynchronous Graph Processing on GPU with Hybrid Coloring Model
---
# Introduction
GPUs have been widely used to accelerate graph processing for complicated computational problems regarding graph theory. Many parallel graph algorithms adopt the asynchronous computing model to accelerate the iterative convergence. Unfortunately, the consistent asynchronous computing requires locking or the atomic operations, leading to significant penalties/overheads when implemented on GPUs. To this end, coloring algorithm is adopted to separate the vertices with potential updating conflicts, guaranteeing the consistency/correctness of the parallel processing. Common coloring algorithms, however, may suffer from low parallelism because of a large number of colors generally required for processing a large-scale graph with billions of vertices.

Frog is a light-weight asynchronous processing framework with a hybrid coloring model. It includes three parts: a hybrid graph coloring algorithm, an asynchronous execution model, and a streaming execution engine on GPUs. The first two parts are most critical in our design. The fundamental idea is based on Pareto principle (or 80-20 rule) about coloring algorithms as we observed through masses of real graph coloring cases.
